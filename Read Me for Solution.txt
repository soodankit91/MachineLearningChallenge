This provides guidelines for using the source code for the solution of Machine Learning Challenge for Paytm labs

Rating.java contains the main method


The solution requires 5 arguments to be passed.

1st - path to the transactions dataset 		       : Input File
2nd - path to the profits dataset  		       : Input File
3rd - path to the cancellations data set	       : Input File
4th - path to a file where we want the merchant rating as per different categories : Output File
5th - path to a file where we want the merchant rating (final result) : Output File

A note regarding the output files:

1.the first output file (4th argument) shows merchant rating at category and sub category level, that is, rating for all
merchants for every T1, T2 and T4 the merchant deals with.

2.the second output file (5th argument) shows the total merchant rating.



Results:

Two results files have been attached

1. MerchantRatingCategorywise.txt : Corresponds to input argument 4 - contains rating at category and sub category level
2. MerchantRatingTotal.txt : Corresponds to input argument 5 - contains overall rating of merchants
